# Hangman

## Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## What I learned in this project

I learnt how to use classes to organise code into efficient blocks - rather than have a sprawling and difficiult-to-navigate collection of code. This is not something that I have come across before and I was implementing learning from lessons straight into the project.
